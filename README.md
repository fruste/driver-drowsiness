# driver-drowsiness
The code of my master thesis titled "Deriving, analysing and classifying discriminative facial features indicative of driver drowsiness from a limited labelled dataset". This repository contains all the code that was used for deriving analysing and classifying the discriminative facial features. Also, the eye openess features, that can be used to create the shallow features, are included in the "eye_openess_features" directory.
